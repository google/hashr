# HashR in docker

Follow these steps to set-up HashR running in a docker container.

If you want a local installation, check [these steps](https://github.com/google/hashr#setting-up-hashr).

## HashR docker image

You can either use our hosted docker image or build it yourself.

### Pull the HashR image

The HashR docker image will provide the HashR binary and tools it needs to
work.

By default the latest tagged release will be pulled if not specified otherwise:

```shell
docker pull us-docker.pkg.dev/osdfir-registry/hashr/release/hashr
```

Pulling a specific release tag:

```shell
docker pull us-docker.pkg.dev/osdfir-registry/hashr/release/hashr:v1.7.1
```

### Build the HashR image

From the repository root folder run the following command:

```shell
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Setup a database and importers

### Database

You still need to provide your own database for HashR to store the results.
Check the [Setting up storage for processing tasks](https://github.com/google/hashr#setting-up-storage-for-processing-tasks) step in the local installation
guide.

### Importers

Follow the [Setting up importers](https://github.com/google/hashr#setting-up-importers)
guide to setup the importers you want to use.

Come back here for running HashR in docker with specific importers.

### Docker networking

Create a docker network that will be used by `hashr_postgresql` and the `hashr`
container.

```shell
docker network create hashr_net
```

```shell
docker network connect hashr_net hashr_postgresql
```

## Run HashR

Get all availalbe HashR flags

```shell
docker run us-docker.pkg.dev/osdfir-registry/hashr/release/hashr -h
```

### Examples

> **NOTE**
Ensure that the host directory mapped into `/data/` in the container is
readable for all!

Run HashR using the `iso9660` importer and export results to PostgreSQL:

```shell
docker run -it \
  --privileged \
  --network hashr_net \
  -v ${pwd}/ISO:/data/iso \
  us-docker.pkg.dev/osdfir-registry/hashr/release/hashr \
  -storage postgres \
    -postgres_host hashr_postgresql \
    -postgres_port 5432 \
    -postgres_user hashr \
    -postgres_password hashr \
    -postgres_db hashr \
  -importers iso9660 \
    -iso_repo_path /data/iso/ \
  -exporters postgres
```

Run hashr using the `deb` importer and export results to PostgreSQL:

```shell
docker run -it \
  --network hashr_net \
  -v ${pwd}/DEB:/data/deb \
  us-docker.pkg.dev/osdfir-registry/hashr/release/hashr \
  -storage postgres \
    -postgres_host hashr_postgresql \
    -postgres_port 5432 \
    -postgres_user hashr \
    -postgres_password hashr \
    -postgres_db hashr \
  -importers deb \
    -deb_repo_path /data/deb/ \
  -exporters postgres
```

### Debugging

Here are some known issues that you can run into when using hashr with docker.

#### Folder: permission denied

If you get a permission error from hashr when working with docker volumes ensure
that the folder you are mapping into the container has the same group id as the
hashr group inside the container. Most likely this will be the `1000`. To change
the group, run:

`sudo chown -R :1000 <DIR>`

#### mount: permission denied

Some importers need to mount the provided file (e.g. ISO files). This is not
supported inside the docker container by default. To workaround this issue, use
the `--privileged` flag with your `docker run` command.

#### Debugging inside the container

To debug problems inside the hashr container start an interactive shell like
with the following command:

```
docker run -it \
  --network hashr_net \
  --entrypoint=/bin/bash \
  us-docker.pkg.dev/osdfir-registry/hashr/release/hashr
```
